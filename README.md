# Movie Inspire
Project created by Jung Eun Choi and Sharon Wong.

The Movie Inspire Application is a quick movie search web application to inspire users on what movie to watch based on movie genre preferences. It is an all-in-one platform where users do not need to search the web for additional information about the movies. We chose to build a web application because it can be accessed through usersâ€™ desktop or mobile devices and it is where people generally go to when searching for movies.
